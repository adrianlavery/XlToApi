# Excel to API

This repo started from an ask to take data from an excel file and push to an API expecting a JSON payload. I took the staring point from a blog Scot Hansleman posted in 2019 [Converting an Excel Worksheet into a JSON document with C# and .NET Core and ExcelDataReader](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/converting-an-excel-worksheet-into-a-json-document-with-c-and-net-core-and-exceldatareader)
